1. consider a list (list = []). You can perform the following commands:
insert i e: Insert integer at position .
print: Print the list.
remove e: Delete the first occurrence of integer .
append e: Insert integer at the end of the list.
sort: Sort the list.
pop: Pop the last element from the list.
reverse: Reverse the list.
Initialize your list and read in the value of followed by lines of commands where each command will be of the types listed above. Iterate through each command in order and perform the corresponding operation on your list.

sol:-
# inserting element at  particular position 
list=[10,20,30,40,50,30]
list.insert(1,2)
# printing the list
print(list)
# deletion of first occurence of element
list.remove(30)
print(list)
# insert the element at end of a list
list.append(60)
print(list)
# sort the list
print(sorted(list))
# pop the last element from the list
list.pop()
print(list)
# Reverse the list
print(list[::-1])


2.Write a Calculator program in Python?

sol:-
def add(P, Q):      
   return P + Q   
def subtract(P, Q):      
   return P - Q   
def multiply(P, Q):      
   return P * Q   
def divide(P, Q):       
   return P / Q        
print ("Please select the operation.")    
print ("a. Add")    
print ("b. Subtract")    
print ("c. Multiply")    
print ("d. Divide")    
    
choice = input("Please enter choice (a/ b/ c/ d): ")    
    
num_1 = int (input ("Please enter the first number: "))    
num_2 = int (input ("Please enter the second number: "))    
    
if choice == 'a':    
   print (num_1, " + ", num_2, " = ", add(num_1, num_2))    
    
elif choice == 'b':    
   print (num_1, " - ", num_2, " = ", subtract(num_1, num_2))    
    
elif choice == 'c':    
   print (num1, " * ", num2, " = ", multiply(num1, num2))    
elif choice == 'd':    
   print (num_1, " / ", num_2, " = ", divide(num_1, num_2))    
else:    
   print ("This is an invalid input")



3.Write a program to concatenate, reverse and slice a string?

sol:-
#concatenate the two strings
string1=input("enter the string1:")
string2=input("enter the string2:")
c=string1+string2
print(c)
# reversing the string
print(c[::-1])
# string slicing
a=c[0]
print(a)
b=c[1:5]
print(b)
d=c[1::]
print(d)



4.Why is Python a popular programming language?

sol:-
In short, Python is a general-purpose language that is easy to learn and use. Due to its popularity, there is a big and helpful community. Also, Python is backed up by big companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook. Python is suggested as the first programming language to learn due to its English-like syntax.


5.What are the other Frameworks that can be used with python?

sol:-
1. Django
2. Pyramid 
3. TurboGears
4. Web2py
5. CherryPy
6. Flask
7. Sanic

6.Full form of WSGI?

sol:-
The Web Server Gateway Interface is a simple calling convention for web servers to forward requests to web applications or frameworks written in the Python programming language.
